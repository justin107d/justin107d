## Welcome to my Github!

I am currently living and working in Connecticut both in pensions and as a fencing coach.  I have been playing with python for a few years now and have recently been diving into django and front-end development.  Please feel free to reach out if you would like to talk about coding in general, a project, to network or if you would like help.  I am a semi regular attendee of the Connecticut coders meet up at the Rocky Hill Starbucks on Sunday mornings and can be found on LinkedIn below.
